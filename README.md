# Deno WebExtension Boilerplate

Boilerplate to build a Deno + Preact-UI Browser Extension.
Basically, `built.ts` uses esbuild to build js into the `dist` dir, and updates manifest stuff for v2 (ff) and v3 (chrome).

fwiw I built [Bext](https://github.com/bpevs/bext) so that you don't have to think about it. `build.ts` here is basically the Bext `main.ts` script. But if you want max control, I guess you can start here. This app is a mirror of the [preact_example](https://github.com/bpevs/bext/tree/main/examples/preact_app) + `build.ts`

You need to download [Deno](https://deno.land/) in order to build this app.

| Commands                  | What they Do                               |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `deno run -A build.ts`    | bundles extension                          |
| `deno run -A build.ts -w` | watch extension                          |

If you have bundled using make commands, you should be able to load your
unpacked extension using a browser.
